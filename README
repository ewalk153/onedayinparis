# One day in Paris
Can you visit every Paris Metro station in one day?

We're answering that question with this project. (Yes, we have a solution in under 14 hours)

I believe the graph data came from here originally:

# Setup

Run the commands in bin/setup

# Execution

```
ruby build_data.rb
ruby route.rb
python tsp.py
```

You can then visualize the route using `plotter-app`.
